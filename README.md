# Mosquito-Olfaction
The remarkable capabilities organized by the brain — from seeing to singing, from remembering to running — originate in the electrical activities of neurons. Neurons interact with each other forming circuits, which process sensory information and drive appropriate behaviors. We are interested in understanding the fundamental mechanisms used by neural circuits for processing information. We use the insect olfactory system (sense of smell) as a model system as it is amenable to detailed in vivo experiments and at the same complex enough to provide insights into our own brains. Our initial focus is on understanding the brain mechanisms that govern how specific smells become attractive or repulsive to mosquitoes. We use a variety of techniques, including in vivo electrophysiology, histology, behavioral observations, genetic manipulations, and computational modeling.
